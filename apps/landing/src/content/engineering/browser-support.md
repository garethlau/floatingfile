**TLDR: Use any browser on mac or windows, use Safari on iPhones, use Google Chrome on Android.**

In release [v3.1](/changelog#v3.1), the decision was made to disable the ability to download files on mobile browsers due to inconsistent support.

> "All browsers now open the requested file in a new tab. To visually reflect this change, using the mobile version of floatingfile will show different buttons indicating the functionality (download or open)."<br><br> -[v3.1 Release Note](/changelog#v3.1)
