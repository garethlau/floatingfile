(1) New Logo

New year, new logo! We're rolling out a new logo that's truer to our name.

(2) Performance Improvements

The capacity and duration of spaces has been increased with v3.2. Spaces and files are now automatically deleted after 24 hours (spaces from 3 hours and files from 1 hour). As well, the previous 300 MB size limit on individual files has been replaced with a limit of 1 GB storage capacity across all files in the space.

**For those interested in the technical details:** The previous single file size limit was due to a bandwidth constraint of the server. Previously, files were first sent to the server and then uploaded to S3 (from the server). This was wildly inefficient as the server wasn't doing anything with the file data. With this release, files are uploaded to S3 from the client (browser) using a signed URL generated by the server. From our testing, we've seen upload speeds increase by around 2x.

(3) File Upload Queue

Files that are selected to be uploaded are now visible in a queue. As well, each file can be individually cancelled. The upload queue is currently not available for mobile, but we hope to bring a similar feature (in a different format) to mobile users soon.
