This update adds two long-awaited quality of life improvements.

### Download Progress Indicator

Downloading files now displays a download percentage. When downloading multiple files, the progress of each file is shown along with the number of files downloaded over the total number of downloads queued. Download progress indicators have been implemented in the iOS since release so these updates only change the web application.

_For a single file:_

_For multiple files:_

### File Previews

We've also introduced file previews for some file types on both web and mobile. Currently, only images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) are supported but we hope to extend this feature for other file types soon. ðŸ¤ž

**A note on performance impact:** File previews are generated at a resolution of 64x64 at 75% quality. Previews have been on average 1.5 KB and doesn't have a significant effect on load performance. From our testing, generating a low resolution image preview adds around two seconds to the total file upload time.
