Link sharing and quality of life improvements.

**NEW** floatingfile Tunnel

floatingfile Tunnel is a URL shortener. It adopts a similar approach of sharing to the main file sharing platform. Enter any valid URL and a six-character code will be generated. Use the code to access the website from any device. To try it out, head over to [app.floatingfile.space/tunnel](https://app.floatingfile.space/tunnel).

Web Updates:
