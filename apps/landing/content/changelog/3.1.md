**Additional Details**

(1) We've changed the way file downloads are handled for mobile.

All browsers now open the requested file in a new tab. To visually reflect this change, using the mobile version of floatingfile will show different buttons indicating the functionality (download or open). This means we are no longer tracking file downloads for mobile users; however we believe this change is neccessary for consistency and usability.
