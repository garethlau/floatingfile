# Version 3 is here! ðŸŽ‰

![](/images/space-ui.png)

We're rolling out a complete UI refresh for the desktop application along with small adjustments to improve the overall experience.

- History persists to the space, not to the current session (persists between page refreshes)
- A random color-animal nickname is generated and saved for your browser
- Removed limit on the number of users in a space
- Now able to download, zip, and delete selected files

We've also temporarily removed the ability to adjust space settings while we reconsider which settings are useful for the average user.

### Other updates

- New changelog page
- Updated privacy policy and terms of service
