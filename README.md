[floatingfile](https://floatingfile.space) is a file sharing platform that marries the flexibility of file storage applications with the convenience of file transfer applications.

If you'd like to try out the latest features, try out [beta.floatingfile.space](https://beta.floatingfile.space). Spaces created using the beta application are compatible with the production application.

## Motivation

floatingfile was built to improve the process of moving files from university workstations to personal computers. A login-free and flexible solution was needed. For more info, see [here](https://floatingfile.space/faq?active=5).

## Repositories

Excluding the repository behind the floatingfile iOS application, there are three active repositories that support floatingfile.

- [floatingfile-client](https://github.com/garethlau/floatingfile-client) - The client application
- [floatingfile-api](https://github.com/garethlau/floatingfile-api) - The server that fulfills web and iOS request
